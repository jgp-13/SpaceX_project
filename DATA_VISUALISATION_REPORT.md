# SpaceX Data Visualisation Report  

## Overview  
This report presents key visual insights derived from the **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data analysis**. It serves as a complement to the **[main project analysis](./README.md)** by focusing on graphical trends and interactive data representations.  


## Success Rate Over Time  
Falcon 9 first-stage landing success rates have shown **steady improvement** over time, particularly after 2014, when booster reuse technology was refined.  

![Success Rate Over Time](./notebooks/figures/l5_year_vs_success_rate.jpg)  

- **Key Observation**: Landing success surpassed **80% by 2020**, indicating significant advancements in reusable rocket technology.  

## Influence of Payload Mass on Landing Success  
An analysis of payload mass revealed no direct correlation with landing success, though **earlier missions exhibited a higher failure rate**.  

![Flight Number vs Payload Mass](./notebooks/figures/l5_flight_number_vs_payload_mass.jpg)  

- **Before Flight 35**, failures were more frequent.  
- **Beyond this point**, landing success stabilised despite variations in payload mass.  

### Payload Distribution by Orbit Type  
Different orbit types influence payload mass constraints and landing probabilities.  

![Payload Mass vs Orbit](./notebooks/figures/l5_payload_mass_vs_orbit.jpg)  

- **Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO)**: Payloads ranged between **3 and 8 tons**, reflecting the high energy demands for placement in geostationary orbit.  
- **International Space Station (ISS) Orbit**: Concentrated around **2.5 tons**, aligning with ISS resupply missions.  
- **Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO)**: Hosted **the heaviest payloads**, with **most missions achieving successful landings**.  

## Geospatial Analysis: Launch Sites & Landing Success  
Launch performance varied across different **SpaceX launch sites**, affecting landing success rates.  

### Kennedy Space Center (KSC)  
![Success at KSC](./notebooks/figures/l6_SR_at_KSC.png)  
- A **high success rate** was observed at this site, with most failed landings occurring during the early years.  

### Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS)  
![Success at CCSFS](./notebooks/figures/l6_SR_at_CCSFS.png)  
- **Landing success improved significantly** over time, with **early failures concentrated in 2015â€“2016**.  

### Payload Distribution by Launch Site  
The following figure illustrates how payload masses were distributed across different launch sites.  

![Flight Number vs Launch Site](./notebooks/figures/l5_flight_number_vs_launch_site.jpg)  

- **CCSFS SLC-40**: Primarily used for **payloads below 10 tons and some above 14 tons**.  
- **KSC LC-39A**: Supported a **broader payload range (2â€“16 tons)**, indicating greater operational flexibility.  
- **Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB)**: Used mostly for missions with **payloads around 10 tons**.  

## Orbit-Based Landing Success Rates  
An analysis of orbit types and their respective landing success rates revealed key patterns.  

![Flight Number vs Orbit](./notebooks/figures/l5_flight_number_vs_orbit.jpg)  

![Orbit vs Success Rate](./notebooks/figures/l5_orbit_vs_avg_success.jpg)  

- **GTO missions experienced moderate landing success**, likely due to the higher energy demands for such missions.  
- **VLEO missions recorded the highest success rates**, reinforcing the reliability of booster recovery for lower-altitude orbits.  

## Machine Learning Predictions  
A machine learning model was developed to classify **booster landing success** based on historical launch data.  

### Model Performance Comparison  
- **Logistic Regression** achieved the highest **in-sample accuracy (94.4%)**.  
- **Decision Tree** exhibited the **smallest discrepancy between training and test performance**, suggesting better generalisation.  
- **Overall test accuracy** remained at **83.3% across all models**, indicating consistent performance.  

## Interactive Dashboard  
A **Tableau dashboard** was developed to allow dynamic filtering of **launch success probabilities, booster recovery trends, and orbit-based performance metrics**.
